# Advent of Code 2021

This year, for Advnet of Code I'll be using [Dart](https://dart.dev/). This is a very unusual programming language for research software, but it is the basis of the development of mobile applications using [Flutter]((https://flutter.dev/). As the RSE Team is interested into getting in that world, this AoC is an excellent excuse to start doing it.
